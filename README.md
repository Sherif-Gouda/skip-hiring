# Skip Selection Screen

This project is a redesign of a "Skip Selection" screen using **React**. The goal was to improve the user interface and user experience, add filtering capabilities, and manage the application's state effectively.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (via [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)) for fast development and hot reloading  
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience  
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and responsive styling  
- **Context API** for global state management  

## Approach

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Reworked the layout and visuals to improve readability and interaction  
- Focused on clear typography, consistent spacing, and intuitive button behavior  
- Improved responsiveness for different screen sizes  

### Filtering Functionality
- Added a filtering feature to help users quickly find the desired skip  
- Designed with performance and user experience in mind  

### State Management
- Utilized **React's Context API** for managing shared state across components  
- Chose Context for its simplicity and suitability for this scoped use case  

### Developer Experience
- Used **Vite** to streamline the development workflow with fast build and dev server  
- Used TypeScript to catch bugs early and improve code maintainability  
- Kept the component structure modular and easy to understand for future extensibility
